### ArTrade Trading Rules

During a trade, merchants and requesters must follow the trading rules listed below.

- We highly recommend that requesters only trade with our merchants, and not the members.
- Requesters need to send the full amount (including bonus) before merchants can proceed with their part.
- Both parties are only allowed to exchange items, and must not involve other currencies.
- Both parties are advised to take screenshots or screen recordings during a trade.
- If there's an issue, you must report to the group owners.

## 3. Scam Insurance

ArTrade provides insurance for any scam related incidents during a trade. You must share screenshots or screen recordings of the incident with one of our group owners. Once the evidence is verified, our insurance account will send you the full amount in items. The rules are listed below.

- You must be a member of the group to claim the insurance.
- The insurance only applies when trading with one of our merchants.
- The insurance does not cover trade value exceeding 10000 coins.
